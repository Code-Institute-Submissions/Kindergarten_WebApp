# Kindergarten:
Presentation of static data for the parents who wanted to enrol their children in that preschool.
Information consists of the preschool activities, how they work curriculum defines goals that the business should strive for.
The educational activities must be carried out so that it stimulates and challenges the development and learning of children.
All information about preschool teachers and nurses working in that preschool.
## UX:
In general, present information about kindergartens and their substance and goals. this website is for the parents who want to enrol their children in that preschool. 
And to help them to get all information about the kindergartens and contact information. 
Information that is available in this website is about the staff, what experience they have, and what activity they have for children. 
And what did says those other parents who have children in this kindergarten about the kindergarten?
## Existing Features:
There are four general pages (Home, Contact, About us, Our staff and the login). In the pages (Home, Contact, about us, our staff) that present all information about kindergarten and their activity,
staff and goals. and how to contact them if a parent wanted to enrol his/her child in the kindergartens. 
## Features Left to Implement:
-	Login: I have done layout (UX Design) but logic should be done in the future.
-	profile page: Displays all information about children's activities that are enrolled in preschool for their parents.
-	Every child should have a private profile that should be accessible only to him/her. It shows how he/she is developing and some info about him/her.
## Technologies Used:
-	Code Instistute: materials and homework and projector during the lesson.
-	bootstrap 4: to perform responsive for the WepApp.
-	JavaScript: to perform the active class for the navbar links.
-	Websites like: (stackoverflow.com, css-tricks.com, w3schools.com). 
## Testing
I have tested web page with my mentor. initially I got some feedback and I made a little changes.
-	Home page: have changed the background image and made it more impact. It was a gap between the image and the footer, and I have added parents comments (what they think about kindergarten).
-	Contact us page: I have changed the hole page and make it more consistency with other pages. 
    Have tested the form to submit the empty inputs and verify that an error message about the required fields appears and it work.
-	Tested all pages are responsive and work on small devices.
